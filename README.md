The Personal Navigation Asistant (Mars, SPACE APPS CHALLENGE)
The challenge we are rioght now is from the section "Can You Build A" called "Make sense out of Mars".


This Project is a proposal upgrade for the actual rover to improve its functionality with the human when he explore mars.

When the rover is not piloted it will drop little cones that function by themself using sensors and sending the data analyzed to the 
human. 

In the following files there will be a short explaining about our idea to make sense out of mars.

# Communication
This part is about a local signal to implement in mars to improve the time it takes to the e3xplorer to be aware of something
happening in the planet, like a storm incomming.
